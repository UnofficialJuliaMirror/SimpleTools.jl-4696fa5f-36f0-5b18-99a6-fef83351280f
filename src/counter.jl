"""
A `Counter` is a device for keeping a count of how often we observe
various objects. It is created by giving a type such as
`c=Counter{String}()`.

Counts are retrieved with square brackets like a dictionary: `c["hello"]`.
It is safe to retrieve the count of an object never encountered, e.g.,
`c["goodbye"]`; in this case `0` is returned.

Counts may be assigned with `c[key]=amount`, but the more likely use
case is using `c[key]+=1` to count each time `key` is encountered.
